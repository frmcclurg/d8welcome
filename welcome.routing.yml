# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses "http://localhost/welcome" the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as the classname: ("\Drupal\welcome\Controller\WelcomeController")
# and the method: ("welcome")

# The name of the route consists of the following parts:
#   welcome: Name of the module
#   welcome_controller: Name of the controller
#   welcome: Name of the method that handles the request when URL is specified
welcome.welcome_controller_welcome:
  # URI path to page.  This is the URI that is mapped to the controller.
  # When the user goes to the /welcome on the site, the controller method
  # is invoked and is responsible to display the content for the page.
  path: '/welcome'
  defaults:
    # This defines the controller and method.
    # The controller is defined with the path to the class name "WelcomeController".
    # The \Drupal is the Drupal namespace.
    # The method name "welcome()".
    _controller: '\Drupal\welcome\Controller\WelcomeController::welcome'
    # Title of the page
    _title: 'Welcome Controller title'
  requirements:
    # Control who has access to the page.
    # Permissions "access content" means anyone with this permission
    # will be able to use the URI to retrieve and view the content.
    _permission: 'access content'
