# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses "http://localhost/welcome" the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\welcome\Controller\WelcomeController")
# and a method ("welcome").

# Internal machine name
welcome.welcome_controller_welcome:
  # URL path to page
  path: '/welcome'
  defaults:
    # Controller defined with class name "WelcomeController" and method name "welcome()".
    _controller: '\Drupal\welcome\Controller\WelcomeController::welcome'
    # Page title
    _title: 'Welcome Controller title'
  requirements:
    # Control who has access to the page
    _permission: 'access content'
